            We present a categorical point of view on dynamical quantum groups in terms of categories of Harish-Chandra bimodules. We prove Tannaka duality theorems for forgetful functors into the monoidal category of Harish-Chandra bimodules in terms of a slight modification of the notion of a bialgebroid. Moreover, we show that the standard dynamical quantum groups F(G) and F_q(G) are related to parabolic restriction functors for classical and quantum Harish-Chandra bimodules. Finally, we exhibit a natural Weyl symmetry of the parabolic restriction functor using Zhelobenko operators and show that it gives rise to the action of the dynamical Weyl group.

            We suggest a mirror family for the Jacobian varieties of hyperelliptic curves based on computation of the (surprisingly, nontrivial) J-function via the abelian/nonabelian correspondence of Ciocan-Fontanine--Kim--Sabbah, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0610265">arXiv:math/0610265</a>, exploring in detail genus two case.

            We study the GLSM describing in one limit a geometric theory on the Jacobians of hyperelliptic curves. In particular, we show how the other limit is related to the "symmetric product" of geometric theories on the corresponding hyperelliptic curve.

            We show that nonequivariance of Kontsevich star-products is measured by the second non-abelian cohomology classes with some conditions on them.
